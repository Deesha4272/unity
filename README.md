# Unity
## Find your community


In a world were there seems to be a lot of political unrest, Unity provides a sense of community in regards to your advocacy for social change. With the power of GIS and app development, visualize your (un)silent supporters. Sourced from the Crowd Counting Consortium, the ArcGIS map displays the political protest distribution as of October 2020. 


**How we built it**
React, ArcGIS, Firebase, CSS

**Challenges we ran into**
Cleaning the data from Crowd Counting Consortium to display as accurate map of protests.

**Accomplishments that we're proud of**
Aesthetic UI (check out how pretty she is!)

**What we learned**
React is amazing! This was our first time using React, but defenitely not the last.

**What's next for Unity**
A messaging feature is coming up next!
